# Distributed training with Kubeflow pipeline
<font size=4>This example demonstrates how to use kubeflow end-to-end to use Tensorflow MuiltiWorkerMirroredStrategy on the local k8s cluster for distributed training, and implement image similarity calculation through facenet algorithm and Opencv face recognition technology.</font>
