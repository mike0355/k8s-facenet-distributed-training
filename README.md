# Distributed training with Kubeflow pipeline
<font size=4>This example demonstrates how to use kubeflow end-to-end to use Tensorflow MuiltiWorkerMirroredStrategy on the local k8s cluster for distributed training, and implement image similarity calculation through facenet algorithm and Opencv face recognition technology.</font>
# Goals
<font size=4> This tutorial will implement the following items:  
  
*	Use Tensorflow MuiltiWorkerMirroredStrategy to demonstrate distributed training .  
*	Use FaceNet algorithm and OpenCV to implement image similarity caculation .
